For the avoidance of doubt, and by way of an example (but not exhaustive of all other applicable examples), the EBITDA for a Subject Period which is attributable to a Subsidiary, that at any time during that Subject Period was an Excluded Subsidiary, shall nonetheless be included in the Pro Forma EBITDA for such Subject Period if, on either the last day of the Subject Period or the Determination Date such Subsidiary is, for whatever reason, no longer an Excluded Subsidiary, including by reason of discharging the Indebtedness that imposed the applicable Excluded Subsidiary Transfer Restriction or Excluded Subsidiary Transfer Restrictions or having otherwise terminated the application of all related provisions that imposed such restriction or restrictions.\n",
